Sierpinski's Triangle by Brya Tait

makefile commands:

"make all" will make the exe and all needed object files and link them.
"make clean" will remove files created by "make all"

commandline arugments(do this after "make all"):
./S_tri <put an integer number for recursion depth> <a double for triangle length>
(note: to rename the exe assign the EXE variable to somethig else in the makefile)
